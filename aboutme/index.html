   <h2>Bryant Beltran</h2>
    <p>Sup Guys! My name is Bryant Beltran. I am from Los Angeles, California and
         I love the climate in California because I love the hot weather. I am still trying to get accustomed to the cold weather we have in Rexburg.
          Some of my hobbies are playing video games and soccer.
    </p>
    <p>I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints throughout my childhood.
         I have been blessed by the messages our prophets give and what the scriptures reveal great stories that I can connect to my daily life.
    </p>
    <p>I am currently a computer science major and it is also my first year as a Junior at BYUI. I like to code in class and would like to learn more languages in the future.
    </p>
